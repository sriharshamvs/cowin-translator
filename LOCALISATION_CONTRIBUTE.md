# How to contribute to the CoWin Translator ? 

Our project page is : https://code.swecha.org/CivicTech/cowin-translator/
## Steps
1. Please check the data/ directory if the language you wish to add is already present as a csv file  (te.csv for telugu, hi.csv for hindi, be.csv for bengali etc)
2. If it already exists, download the appropriate file. If it does not, download l10n.csv file.
3. You can open the file in any spreadsheet software - LibreOffice Calc, Excel etc 
4. The 'source' column is the string to be translated. Add the translation into 'translation' column. 
5. After the translation is completed, save the file and mail us back. In the mail, do mention the name, email address and the translation language of the contributors. We will publish the addon with the name of the contributors listed. 

For instructions regarding the addon development, please see CONTRIBUTING.md
